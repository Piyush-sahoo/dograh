1. Visit [Vobiz Console](https://console.vobiz.ai/auth/login/)
2. Sign up for a new account
3. Complete email verification
4. You'll receive initial credits for testing

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

1. Log in to your [Vobiz Dashboard](https://console.vobiz.ai/)
2. Find your **Auth ID** and **Auth Token** in the dashboard
3. Copy these credentials securely

### Step 3: Purchase a Phone Number

1. Navigate to the **DID** page in your Vobiz console
2. Browse available numbers by country/region
3. Purchase at least one phone number
4. You'll have enough credits from signup to buy your first number
5. Copy your phone number(s)

### Step 4: Configure in Dograh AI

2. Select **Vobiz** as your provider
3. Enter your credentials:
   - Auth ID
   - Auth Token
   - From Phone Number (with country code, e.g., +918071387428)
4. Click **Save Configuration**

### Step 5: Test Your Configuration

2. Enter a phone number to call (with country code, e.g., +918071387428)
3. Click "Test Call" to verify connection
4. Check call logs for successful connection

## How It Works

### Technical Details

Vobiz integration uses these characteristics:

- **Audio Format**: 8kHz μ-law (MULAW) - same as Twilio
- **Protocol**: WebSocket with JSON messages
- **Authentication**: X-Auth-ID and X-Auth-Token HTTP headers
- **WebSocket**: Base64-encoded audio in JSON messages

### Call Flow

When you initiate a call through Dograh AI:

1. System selects a phone number from your configured pool
2. Dograh generates webhook URLs with cloudflared tunnel
3. Vobiz API initiates the call to your recipient
4. Ring callback confirms the call is ringing
5. Once answered, XML webhook provides WebSocket connection details
6. Audio streams in real-time for voice interaction
7. Hangup callback provides call statistics and costs

## Campaign Features

When using Vobiz with campaigns:

- **Rate Limiting**: 2 calls per second (CPS) to prevent overwhelming
- **Concurrent Calls**: Up to 10 simultaneous calls
- **Cost Tracking**: ₹0.65 per minute for call billing
- **Call Management**: System manages call slots to optimize throughput

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid phone number error">
    Ensure phone numbers include country code in E.164 format: `+918071387428`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication failed">
    - Verify Auth ID and Auth Token are correct
    - Check for extra spaces in credentials
    - Ensure credentials match your Vobiz console exactly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Webhook signature validation failing">
    - Confirm your Auth Token matches exactly
    - Verify the webhook URL is publicly accessible
    - Check cloudflared tunnel is running properly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Calls connecting but disconnecting quickly">
    - Check WebSocket connection logs
    - Verify audio pipeline is configured correctly
    - Ensure VAD and Smart Turn are enabled
    - Review call duration limits in Vobiz console
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Insufficient credits">
    - Log in to Vobiz console and check credit balance
    - Add credits via the billing page

## Best Practices

- **Testing**: Always test with a single call before running campaigns
- **Credentials**: Store Auth ID and Auth Token securely in the database
- **Numbers**: Configure multiple numbers for high-volume campaigns
- **Monitoring**: Check Vobiz console regularly for usage and billing
- **Greeting**: Always configure a greeting message in workflows (required)
- **Audio Quality**: Use default pipeline configuration for best results

## Cost Considerations

Vobiz pricing includes:
- Per-minute charges for calls
- Phone number (DID) rental fees
- Initial credits provided on signup
